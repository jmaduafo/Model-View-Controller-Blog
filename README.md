# Model-View-Controller-Blog

## Description
            
For this assignment, my motive was to create a full-functioning fullstack app where I operate both the frontend and the backend, so I made sure the server ran smoothly and that the schema and the data was coming through to the frontend. I also made sure that the data from the server was displayed on the browser and that the UI was aesthetically pleasing and overall looked good. There were many, many hurdles throughout this assignment and it was as if after I fixed something, something else would occur. This assignment encouraged me to reach out to my learning assistants and ask for help. Usually I'd face the problem by doing research but sometimes sitting for hours trying to figure something out doesn't really help you move forward.

## Installation

To install the project, you must run "npm i" in the terminal

## Usage

In order to use the application, you must run mysql by typing in "mysql -u root -p" and enter in a password. Then run "source db/schema.sql" before switching over to the powershell WHILE the mysql is running. Then you must do "npm run seed", allowing the data to come through. Then enter in "node server" to run the server and browser.
